Welcome to the EnderIO Wiki here on GitHub!

### The Actual Wiki
To view the official wiki, go [here.] (http://wiki.enderio.com) (Very outdated, sorry.)

### Bugs
If you wish to raise a bug, please raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CrazyPants/EnderIO/issues).

Include as much information as you can, including the version of EnderIO and Minecraft. The more info the better, if I can't reproduce it, I probably can't fix it. Screenshots can/would be very helpful.

### Feature Requests
If you wish to request a new feature please do the following:

1. Go to the [Suggestion Tracker](http://ideas.theideawall.com/EnderIO/) and check if somebody hasn't already requested it.

2. If you have done step 1 and it hasn't already been requested, raise a new suggestion. Otherwise vote for the existing one.

3. Smile, you know you want to.

### Making me better
If you would like, you can contribute to the wiki. Fix my awesome typing/spelling, whatever.

Enjoy,
