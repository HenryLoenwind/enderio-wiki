Welcome to the EnderIO wiki!

### Bugs
If you wish to raise a bug, please raise an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CrazyPants/EnderIO/issues).

Make sure you mark it as a bug and include as much information as you can, including the version of the EnderIO and MC. The more info the better, if I can't reproduce it, I probably can't fix it. Screen hots welcome.
